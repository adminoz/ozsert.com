    "meta_description": "Placeholder: Welcome to C. Murad Özsert's personal website. Learn more about him...",
    "slide1_greeting": "Hello,",
    "slide1_paragraph1": "When I stepped into Boğaziçi University Computer Engineering in 2003, I was actually embarking on a long journey, not just a department. I was chasing my curiosity for technology — but back then, I didn't know this curiosity would first lead me to the regular rhythm of the corporate world and then to the ups and downs of the entrepreneurship scene.",
    "slide1_paragraph2": "I spent my early years developing software, designing products, and building systems in large corporate structures. Later, working in more agile environments in medium-sized companies taught me what speed, flexibility, and direct impact meant. During this process, I had the chance to develop products that directly touched the lives of millions of people by working in different sectors such as finance, telecom, and logistics. Every different product, every different sector, was a new perspective and learning area.",
    "slide1_paragraph3": "Then, saying, \"It's time to chart your own course,\" I embarked on the entrepreneurial path I very much wanted to experience. This courage and desire turned into the Yolda.com story after a long research period. I found myself in the world of entrepreneurship with Volkan Özkan, whom I met during İyzico’s exit process.",
    "slide2_paragraph1": "Yolda.com was born with the dream of transforming the logistics sector with technology. The startup, actively operating in Turkey and Germany, received over $10 million in investment. This gave me the opportunity to work with leading and global investors in the field. I was selected into the Endeavor family, consisting of founders of fast-growing startups who make a difference. This entrepreneurial journey pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me to deal with a new crisis every day and another uncertainty every week. (The first shock we experienced was the pandemic starting the month we founded the company :)",
    "slide2_paragraph2": "This process, which took place amidst sharp changes in the investment ecosystem's perspective on startups and local-global economic fluctuations, was sometimes exciting and sometimes stressful — but in every aspect, it was extremely instructive and transformative. Throughout all these ups and downs, I always focused on developing, creating value, and making a difference while staying on the road and on track.",
    "slide2_paragraph3": "After transferring Yolda.com to one of Turkey's leading logistics companies, I was at a new crossroads. I turned my focus to artificial intelligence and understanding, explaining, and developing AI-supported products for its transformative power in the business world.",
    "slide3_paragraph1": "Today, I continue to work on innovative systems and business models that bring technology and people together. I provide consultancy to startups and corporate companies on these topics that I am interested in and think about. I believe that artificial intelligence carries a potential that is not limited to algorithms but also reshapes our ways of thinking and working. A future where those who can adapt this potential to their own business will continue to survive is now very close.",
    "slide3_paragraph2": "This site is part of this journey. You can subscribe to my weekly artificial intelligence articles to share my story, my experiences, and the possibilities we can brainstorm together. Maybe one day, somewhere, our stories will intersect, and we'll chat.."

Actively operating in Turkey and Germany, Yolda.com set out to transform the logistics sector with technology and received over $10 million in investment. This process taught me what rapid growth, decision-making, and staying afloat amidst uncertainties mean.",
    "slide1_paragraph3": "After transferring Yolda.com to one of Turkey's largest logistics companies, I turned my focus to artificial intelligence. Today, I provide consultancy to startups and corporate structures on AI-based business models and systems; I develop innovative solutions that bring technology and people together.",
    "slide1_paragraph4": "We are at the beginning of an era where those who can correctly understand and integrate artificial intelligence into their business will make a difference, while those who cannot will struggle. If you want to think together and follow this new world order where small teams in terms of human resources but large in terms of impact will multiply, you can subscribe to my weekly artificial intelligence newsletter."
