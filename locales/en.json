    "title": "C. Murad Özsert - About",
    "meta_description": "Welcome to C. Murad Özsert's personal website. Learn more about him...",
    "slide1_greeting": "Hello,",
    "slide1_paragraph1": "When I started at Boğaziçi University Computer Engineering in 2003, I was actually embarking on a long journey, not just a department. I was following my curiosity for technology — but back then, I didn't know this curiosity would first lead me to the regular rhythm of the corporate world, and later to the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial scene.",
    "slide1_paragraph2": "I spent my early years developing software, designing products, and building systems for large corporate companies. Later, I worked in more agile environments at medium-sized companies. This taught me what speed, flexibility, and direct impact mean. During this process, I had the chance to develop products that directly touched the lives of millions by working in different sectors such as finance, telecom, and logistics. Every different product, every different sector, was a new perspective and learning area for me.",
    "slide1_paragraph3": "Then, saying, 'It's time to chart your own course,' I embarked on the entrepreneurial path I had long wanted to experience. After a long period of research, this motivation turned into the Yolda.com story. Together with Volkan Özkan, whom I met (and later became friends with), we found ourselves in the world of entrepreneurship.",
    "slide2_paragraph1": "Yolda.com was born with the dream of transforming the logistics sector with technology. Within 2 years, the startup expanded from Turkey to Germany and Europe, receiving over $10 million in investment. This gave me the opportunity to work with leading and global investors. I was selected into the Endeavor family, consisting of founders of fast-growing startups who make a difference. This entrepreneurial journey pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me to deal with a new crisis and another uncertainty every day. (The first month we founded the company, the pandemic affected the whole world, which was a sign of how tough the journey would be.)",
    "slide2_paragraph2": "This challenging time between 2020 and 2024, which took place sharp changes in the investment ecosystem's perspective on startups and local-global economic fluctuations, was sometimes exciting and sometimes stressful — but in every aspect, it was extremely instructive and transformative. Throughout all these ups and downs, I always focused on staying on the road, developing, creating value, and making a difference.",
    "slide2_paragraph3": "Due to the high capital requirements of Yolda.com's business model and the tightening of monetary policies in the investment world, it became impossible to achieve the high investment we aimed for when founding the company. In light of all these developments, after exiting the company to one of Turkey's leading logistics companies, I found myself at a new crossroads. I turned my focus to artificial intelligence and to understanding, explaining, and developing AI-powered products for its transformative power in today's world.",
    "slide3_paragraph1": "Now, I continue to work on building innovative products that blend technology and humanity. In addition to the transformative effects of artificial intelligence on our lives, I believe it has the potential to reshape our ways of thinking and working — in short, the whole world itself. A future where those who can adapt this potential to their own business will continue to survive is not far away.",
    "slide3_paragraph2": "If you want to follow this new world together, where small teams in terms of team size but large in terms of impact will multiply, you can subscribe to my weekly AI newsletter."
